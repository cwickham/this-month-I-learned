# The way I learn

1. Do an example with guidance
2. Apply it to something I care about
3. Teach it to someone else

But this all requires:

0. Know it exists

How do I get exposure to things?

# The things I learnt

* Why should you learn it?
* How do you do it?

# Higher level things

* Everyone is still learning
* Pick your battles
* Give yourself permission/time to learn 
* Find what works for you - for me, sporadic, intensive R time usually built around conferences.
