# This Month I Learned

## Summary

No matter how much you learn, 
there always seems to be something new in the world of R.
How do you keep abreast of the changes, 
and keep your knowledge up-to-date?

In this talk, 
I'll share some things I learned this month,
and how I went about it.
It will cover an eclectic mix of new things from 
packages in the tidyverse, R and RStudio.

I hope you'll either learn something new, or
learn a new strategy for staying up to date.
